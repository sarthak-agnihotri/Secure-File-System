1. Setting Up Your Environment
Install Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code as your IDE.

Install GCC or MinGW as your compiler to execute C++ programs.

Create separate files for each module, or start with a single main.cpp file for simplicity.
2. Begin with the Authentication Module
Code Outline:
Implement a registration system that saves usernames and hashed passwords to a text file.

Add a login system to verify credentials.

Create a basic OTP system to simulate Two-Factor Authentication.
3. Implement File Operations
Use <fstream> to create functions for reading, writing, and viewing files.

Add metadata handling using <sys/stat.h>.
4. Add Encryption
Start with a simple XOR-based encryption.
5. Build the Threat Detection System
Focus on input validation to prevent buffer overflows
6. Test Each Module
After completing one module, test it thoroughly before moving to the next. Start with login and OTP, then file operations, and finally encryption.
